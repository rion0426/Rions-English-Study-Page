There are different **measures** of “healthy” and “overweight.”
BMI (body mass index) is **widely** used by health professionals and has a strong **correlation** with various diseases and **chronic** conditions.
However, it doesn't **reflect** the amount of fat or muscle in a body, bone weight, or **cultural** factors, age and gender (women tend to carry more fat).
Waist **circumference** is another commonly used measure because **excess** abdominal fat — more than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women — **increases** the risk of developing obesity-related conditions.
While both are used to **screen** for **potential** risk, they aren't **diagnostic** tools.
Instead of using weight or measures like BMI to **define** well-being, an **alternative** "health at every size“ approach focuses on **sustainable** health-promoting behavior **regardless** of body size.
**Proponents** argue a weight-neutral approach is healthier because it **avoids** the potentially **harmful** effects of repeated dieting, such as a higher risk of early death and psychological **distress**.
**Ultimately**, nutrition and health are **socioeconomic** issues that require **understanding** and **empathy**.
