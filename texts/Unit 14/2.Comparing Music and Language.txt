The **central role** of music and language in human **existence** and the fact that both involve **complex** and **meaningful** sound sequences naturally **invite** **comparison** between the two **domains**.
Yet from the **standpoint** of modern **cognitive science**, music-language relations have **barely** begun to be **explored**.
This situation appears to be **poised** to change **rapidly**, as researchers from **diverse** fields are increasingly **drawn** to this **interdisciplinary** enterprise.
The **appeal** of such research is easy to understand.
Humans are **unparalleled** in their **ability** to make sense out of sound.
In many other branches of our **experience** (e.g., visual perception, touch), we can learn much from studying the behavior and brains of other animals because our experience is not that different from theirs.
When it comes to language and music, however, our species is **unique**.
This makes it **difficult** to gain **insight** into language or music as a **cognitive system** by comparing humans to other **organisms**.
