Until the camera came along to take photographs of living butterflies, the **standard** image of a butterfly was a **grossly** **distorted** one.
It shows them not as they are in life but in death, **mounted** on a pin in a museum.
The wings are held out **flat** at ninety degrees to the body â€” a **posture** which would **sorely** test the **ligaments** of any butterfly.
It is **nevertheless** the shape which we **instantly** **recognise** as 'butterfly', whether in bow-ties or the pasta the Italians call farfalle (after farfalla, a butterfly).
Yet in life butterflies open their wings flat only to enjoy the sun, and some **species** never do it at all, but **settle** with their wings tight shut.
Even when the wings are wide open, they always **slope** downwards more than mounted **specimens**, with the hindwings much closer to the butterfly's body.
