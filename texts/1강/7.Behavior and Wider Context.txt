If you visit a physician's office, your **behavior** is part of a large **context** that has to do with the **specific** goals of the visit, your **overall** plan for the day, and the wider plans and **intentions** of your life, at **varied** time scales, **relative** to which your visit may be of some **significance** or not.
Everything you do in the "**scene**" at that office is **informed** by these **multiple** contents, even if you do not need to hold them all in mind in order to behave **coherently**.
The same happens with the physician, **relative** to his role in the scene.
In a state of **diminished** consciousness, however, all that **background** influence is **reduced** to little or nothing.
The behavior is **controlled** by **immediate** cues, **devoid** of any **insertion** in the wider context.
For example, picking up a glass and drinking from it makes sense if you are **thirsty**, and that action does not need to **connect** with the broader context.
