The **concept** of **sequels** **originated** in the movie **context**.
In the 1920s and 1930s, Hollywood studios had "B units" which **produced** what was then called "**series**" — **loosely** connected **episodes** of a **popular** character's **adventures**, such as Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, or Cisco Kid.
These **serials** were **manufactured** for a **low budget** and with **limited** artistic **ambitions**.
Beneath the Planet of the Apes, made in 1970 by 20th Century Fox, is often **considered** the first "**modern**" sequel — the **continuation** of the studio's **previous** box office hit Planet of the Apes, itself the screen **adaption** of Pierre Boulle's classic novel.
Rather than being the **result** of **strategic** managerial thinking, it was the studio's then-**troubled** **financial** state that made its managers look for ways to **exploit** its **existing** properties.
At a time when sequels were basically **considered** as both **artistically** **inferior** and **commercially** **unattractive**, Fox made what has **developed** over the following **decades** into a family brand with **numerous** products **attached** to it.
