You have an old house and everything is a bit **outdated**, but you're **satisfied**.
You add a room air conditioner during one **particularly** hot summer.
A few years later, when you have more money, you **decide** to add a **central** air-conditioning system.
But you don't **remove** that room unit in the bedroom — why would you?
It might come in **handy** and it's already there, **bolted** to the wall.
Then a few years later, you have a **catastrophic** plumbing problem — pipes **burst** in the walls.
The plumbers need to **break open** the walls and run new pipes, but your central air-conditioning system is now in the way, where some of their pipes would **ideally** go.
So they run the pipes through the attic, the **long way around**.
This works fine until one **particularly** cold winter when your **uninsulated** attic causes your pipes to **freeze**.
These pipes wouldn't have frozen if you had run them through the walls, which you couldn't do because of the central air-conditioning.
If you had **planned** all this from the start, you would have done things **differently**, but you didn't - you added things one thing at a time, as and when you **needed** them.
