Joseph Schumpeter once said that an **invention** that is not **widely** used is **irrelevant** to human **affairs**.
There are thousands of **ingenious** and **admirable** inventions that were neither carried out in **large scale** nor used by millions of people to change the world.
Hero of Alexandria in the first century **produced** a steam engine by jet action, but it was **treated** as a **curiosity** and did not lead to **benefits** for society.
Leonardo da Vinci invented a number of flying machines, but there is no **record** that they were ever built to change **transportation** or **warfare**.
Crawford Long of Georgia actually used ether for **anesthesia** in surgery a few years before William Morton in Massachusetts, but Long did not **publish** his results and had no **influence** in **subsequent** medical history.
Out of the many thousands of inventions in history, only a **few** were able to travel the long and **difficult** path from **discovery** to **development**, to be **manufactured** on a large scale, and to be sold **widely** in the marketplace, and effect **significant** change in the world.
