In the **short run** — the **cyclical** relationship — GDP and happiness go up and down **together**.
During the Great **Recession**, for example, happiness in the United States **collapsed** as the economy **contracted** and then **recovered** as GDP turned **upward**.
But over the **long run** — the **trend** relationship — countries with more **rapid** economic growth do not experience a **greater** increase in happiness.
**Indeed**, in the United States, the trend in happiness has been **flat** for over seven **decades**, a period in which real GDP per capita more than **tripled**.
Even more **spectacular**, China's life **satisfaction** was no higher in 2010 than in 1990, **despite** an **unprecedented** fourfold **multiplication** of real GDP per capita in only two decades.
There are some **scholars** who **claim** to find that happiness trends **upward** along with GDP, but they are **confusing** the **positive** short-term relationship with the **nil** long-term relationship.
The **absence** of a long-term relationship **suggests** that it is time to **reconsider** the long-held **belief** that economic growth **increases** human **well-being**.
