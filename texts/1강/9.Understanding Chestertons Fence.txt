Try to **abide by** the rule that when you **advocate** changing something, you should make sure you **understand** why it is the way it is in the first place.
This rule is known as Chesterton's fence, after G. K. Chesterton, the British writer who **proposed** it in an essay in 1929.
**Imagine** you discover a road that has a fence built across it for no **particular** reason you can see.
You say to yourself, "Why would someone build a fence here? This seems **unnecessary** and stupid, let's **tear it down**."
But if you don't understand why the fence is there, Chesterton **argued**, you can't be **confident** that it's okay to tear it down.
**Long-standing** customs or **institutions** are like those fences, he said.
**Naive** reformers look at them and say, "I don't see the use of this; let's **clear it away**."
But more **thoughtful** reformers reply, "If you don't see the use of it, I **certainly** won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may **allow** you to **destroy** it."
