Just the other day, a **dear** friend of mine â€” a **retired** brigadier - was **narrating** the story of how a line he heard many, many years ago **impacted** him **deeply** and **shaped** his life.
It was his first week in the army. It was a Sunday morning.
The **task** ahead was rather **simple**. They had to run ten miles.
My friend **recalls** having started **enthusiastically**, and then quickly **tiring out**.
After running half the **distance**, he felt he couldn't **continue** any longer.
He felt his legs would **fold up** and he'd **collapse**.
And just as he was about to **give up** and stop, he heard his **commanding officer** say to him, 'Come on, young man. Until now you've been running with your legs. Now run with your **mind**!'
Those words seemed to work like **magic**.
While my friend doesn't quite **recall** what happened **thereafter**, all he **remembers** is that he kept running.
He **finished** the **entire** ten-mile run.
And to this day, he often hears the officer's words **echoing** in his mind.
