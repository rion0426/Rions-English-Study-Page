Jokes, by **definition**, are not to be taken **seriously**. We brush off their **effects** by saying, "It's just a joke," or "I'm only joking." We **dismiss** individuals we don't **respect** in the same way: "He's a total joke." When telling jokes, we **agree** that they are best delivered **lightly**, off-the-cuff â€” however much effort may go into this appearance of **levity**. And that's the **extraordinary** thing about jokes, really: **trivial** as we **insist** they are, still we **treasure** them. We **commit** them carefully to **memory** and **share** them with people we love or people we want to love us. We **support** a **massive** and increasingly **global** joke-manufacturing **industry** of stand-up comedians and all sorts of backroom gag-smiths: sitcom writers, radio DJs, journalists. A sense of **humor** is one of our most **valued** social **assets**; have you met a single person who will **cheerfully** **admit** that they don't have one?
