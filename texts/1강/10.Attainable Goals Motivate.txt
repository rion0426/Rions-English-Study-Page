My friend Mary Pat has a **smart** and **capable** 16-year-old grandson.
He was not doing his **best** in school, much to his parents' **dismay**.
One day he asked his mother if he could **dye** his light brown hair.
"What color?" she asked. "Bright blue!" he said with **enthusiasm**.
Sensing an **opportunity** here, Mom replied only with a number. "3.8."
**Shorthand** for, "If you want blue hair you must **earn** a 3.8 grade point average in school. Otherwise I will say NO to this **crazy** color!"
Mary Pat saw her grandson a few months later **sporting** bright yellow hair.
"I thought you were going to dye your hair blue," she said **quizzically**.
Greg's answer was **short**: "3.5."
When Greg and his mom **realized** a 3.8 grade point average wasn't going to happen they **adjusted** his goal to one more **attainable**, and everyone was **happy**.
Goals **motivate** only when they are **attainable**.
Sometimes they need to **change** to fit the **individual** and the **circumstances**.
