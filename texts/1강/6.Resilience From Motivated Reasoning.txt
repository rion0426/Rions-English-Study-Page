In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman points out an **emotional** **benefit** of **motivated reasoning**: **resilience**.
It's easier to **bounce back** from a **failure** if you can **blame** it on anyone but yourself.
He uses the example of a door-to-door salesperson, a job that involves long strings of **rejection**: "When one has just had a door slammed in one's face by an angry homemaker, the thought that 'she was an awful woman' is clearly **superior** to 'I am an **inept** salesperson.'"
But are those really our only two **options**?
We could instead tell ourselves, "Yes, I **screwed up** that sale. But everyone makes **mistakes**." Or "Yes, I screwed up that sale. Still, I'm **improving**—I used to get doors slammed in my face every day, and now it only happens every week!"
Surely we can find a way to bounce back from our **setbacks** that doesn't **require** us to blame them on other people — an **honest** **coping strategy**.
