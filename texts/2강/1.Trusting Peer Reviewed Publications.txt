In **peer-reviewed** publications, **scholars** who are at **arm's length** from one another **evaluate** a new experiment, report, theory, or **claim**.
They must be **expert** in the **domain** they're **evaluating**.
The method is far from **foolproof**, and peer-reviewed findings are sometimes **overturned**, or papers **retracted**.
Peer review is not the only system to **rely on**, but it provides a good **foundation** in helping us to draw our own **conclusions**, and like democracy, it's the best such system we have.
If something **appears** in Nature, The Lancet, or Cell, for example, you can be sure it went through **rigorous** peer review.
As when trying to decide whether to **trust** a tabloid or a serious news organization, the **odds** are better that a paper **published** in a peer reviewed journal is **correct**.
