The idea that the **effect** of technology on work might **depend** upon the **interaction** between these two **rival** forces — a **harmful** **substituting** force and a **helpful** **complementing** force— is not new.
However, these forces tend not to be **explained** in a **particularly** clear way.
Books, articles, and reports on **automation** can be **confusing**, **hinting** at these two effects but often using **wildly** different terms.
Technology, they say, **displaces** and **augments**, **replaces** and **enhances**, **devalues** and **empowers**, **disrupts** and **sustains**, **destroys** and **creates**.
The **challenge** is to **compete** with computers and to **cooperate** with them, to race against the machines and to run alongside them.
There is talk of the **rise** of machines and the **advance** of humans, of **threatening** robots and **comforting** co-bots, of the **artificial intelligence** of machines and the **augmented intelligence** of human beings.
The future, they say, holds both **obsolescence** and ever-greater **relevance**; technology is a **threat** and an **opportunity**, a **rival** and a **partner**, a **foe** and a **friend**.
