**Motivational psychologists** explain human **behavior** in terms of **deep-seated** psychological **fears**, **desires**, and **needs**.
These needs include **self-esteem**, **social approval**, and a sense of **efficacy**.
Motivational psychology helps us understand, for example, why almost all German **diplomats** before World War I gave **false** or **misleading** reports on the **likely** reactions of European countries to Austrian and German military moves.
The reason is that they were simply **frightened** of the **consequences** of not telling the **notoriously** **intolerant** German foreign ministry what it wanted to hear.
The one German diplomat who **accurately** reported the likely **response** of Britain to a German **violation** of Belgian **neutrality**, Ambassador Prince Karl Lichnowsky in London, was **dismissed** in Berlin as having “gone native,” a **judgmental error** that itself can be **explained** in terms of a **well-documented** motivational-psychological **tendency**: namely, the desire to **avoid** the psychological pain of **admitting** one's own **error**.
Because Germany's entire **strategy** for **swift** victory in 1914 **depended on** Britain staying out of the war, Lichnowsky's accurate reports would have been extremely **unsettling** if they had been **accepted**.
