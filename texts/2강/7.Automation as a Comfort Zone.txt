**Automation** is what most **professionals** have in mind when they think of the **relevance** of technology for their **disciplines**.
They think of how they work today, they **identify** some **inefficient** activities, and then they **imagine** **computerizing** them.
Their **focus** is often on **streamlining** manual or **administrative** work.
Old ways of operating are not **discarded**.
Instead, a drive for **efficiencies** and **cost-savings** leads to an **optimization** of **traditional** professional work.
Although **adjustment** in this spirit could be **undertaken** by introducing better manual systems, most current streamlining across the professions **involves** the **deployment** of technology.
This automation therefore **complements** but does not **fundamentally** change the **central** way in which services are **delivered**.
Automation is the **comfort zone** of technological change for most professionals.
They **recognize** great **scope** for technology in **support** of their current ways of working.
