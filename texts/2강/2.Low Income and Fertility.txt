In a **low-income** society, when people have many children they tend to **spend** whatever money they have on keeping those children **fed**, so there is **little** left over to **invest** in future economic **productivity** (including education for children).
This is a situation that tends to lead to **continuing** poverty.
If there is no **surplus** income, there is nothing for the government to **tax**, so governments don't **expand** infrastructure: they don't build roads to **rural** areas so farmers can get their product to market â€” or water treatment facilities, or electricity grids, or schools.
If farmers can't get their products to market, they may **eventually** give up and move to the cities where they **strain** whatever support infrastructure does exist.
One of the best hopes for a society in this kind of **bind** is to **reduce** fertility.
