Capitalism as an economic system **thrives** on the **essential** role played by **failure** in the subject's **satisfaction**. Without our **enjoyment** of failure and our **constitutive** **allergy** to success, capitalism would never have **developed**. Although **champions** of the capitalist system **preach** success and the system's most **fervent** **defenders** are the successful rather than the **downtrodden**, their **professions** of success **mask** the key role that failure has in the system. Just on a **psychic** level, a sense of failure or **dissatisfaction** **drives** the capitalist to **create** new products or find new markets for existing products, and it **prompts** the consumer to **purchase** new **commodities**. The system itself **expands** because failure **functions** as an economic **engine** for individual capitalists and consumers. Even those who are **successful** find **motivation** in the **fear** of future failure. **Scarcity** is always just around the corner.
