**Capitalism** **Thrives** on **Failure**.
The **promise** of capitalism is that it will create **wealth** by **rewarding** the winners of a **competitive** struggle with **profits**, and that competition will **weed out** the losers.
The economist Joseph Schumpeter's term for this process was "**creative destruction**."
It is a process that is often **painful** for those who lose their jobs or see their businesses fail, but it is also a process that is **essential** for the **long-term** health of the economy.
The fear of failure is a **powerful** **motivator**, and the **possibility** of failure is what makes the **rewards** of success so sweet.
But what happens when the government **steps in** to **protect** the losers from the **consequences** of their failures?
The result is a system in which the winners are not **rewarded** as much as they should be, and the losers are not **punished** as much as they should be.
This is a **recipe** for economic **stagnation**.
