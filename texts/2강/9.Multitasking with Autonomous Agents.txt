When the information **patterns** of human **mentality** are successfully **instantiated** in a digital form, the **potential** arises to make a large (theoretically **unlimited**) number of copies of the **autonomous agent**.
Each **replica** or **simulated** self will then be able to perform **functions** that previously **required** the direct **control** of the **embodied** consciousness, thus creating a group or army of selves to **multiply** the impact and **functionality** of the **authoring** consciousness.
In **contemporary** culture, the **benefits** and **drawbacks** of **multitasking**, that is, **dividing** consciousness into more than one activity at the same time, are often **discussed** and **debated**.
In an **immersive** world filled with Al-equipped avatars, the self will have the **unprecedented** ability to **simultaneously** execute multiple tasks with each of its intelligent agents being able to fully **focus** on its **assigned** activity.
Thus, the development of autonomous agents will help **achieve** the **coexistence** of multitasking and **undivided** attention.
