Leslie doesn't **realize** it, but she **stalled out** from her **fear of failure**.
She **imagined** hundreds of reasons why her ideas might not work, and then used these reasons as "**legitimate**” **excuses** for not taking action.
Leslie needed to **face up to** the fact that she **concocted** her own reasons for **failing to act**, and that the **development** of those reasons, if not **grasped** and **eliminated**, could lead to her being **stymied** further.
Leslie **functions** like many of those who never go forward with their ideas — the professor who never finishes writing his book, the artist who never paints the picture she dreams about and mentions to others, the business person who has a wonderful money-making **scheme** but never **implements** it.
The fear of failure in these people **extends beyond** an **inability** to reach a level of success or a level of **perfection**.
To these people — and Leslie might well be one of them — if their project isn't **flawless**, if it isn't of Nobel Prize quality, then, in their minds, it's a **failure**, and they will **delay** taking action because they cannot **tolerate** being **imperfect**.
