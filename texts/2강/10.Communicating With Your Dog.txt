If your dog **pesters** you for petting when you need to be doing something else, **break off** **visual contact** with him.
You can use your **torso** to push him away with a **body block** (remember not to use your hands) or turn your head away (chin raised) in a **benevolent** but royal **dismissal**.
It's **amazing** how fast dogs will go away if you break off visual contact with them.
It's equally **notable** how hard it is for us humans to do that when we're trying to get our dogs to do something.
All of our **instincts** seem to have us look at our dog, just as **primates** do when they are trying to **communicate** directly with another **individual** in the troop.
But the look that works best, that we use ourselves when we're not thinking about it, is that slightly **snobby**, hard-to-get look when we turn our head away in dismissal.
It works with dogs as well as with humans. **Honest**.
Dogs can take you for **granted** just as anyone else in your social group can, and most of us **hate** being taken for granted.
You might be **stuck** with it from some of the people you know, but you don't have to **put up with it** from your dog.
