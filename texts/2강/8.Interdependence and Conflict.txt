**Interdependence** is where the **condition** of one **depends** on another and **vice versa**.
Simply put, interdependence means **mutual dependence**.
Such a situation is neither good nor bad in itself, and there can be more or less of it.
Marriages are a good example of highly **interdependent** relationships.
The **traditional** Christian marriage **vow** **commits** both partners to stick with it “for richer, for poorer, for better, or for worse."
Interdependence among countries sometimes means richer, sometimes poorer, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.
In the eighteenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau pointed out that along with interdependence comes **friction** and **conflict**.
His "**solution**” was **isolation** and **separation**, but that is **seldom** possible in a **globalized** world.
When countries try isolation, as with the cases of North Korea today and Myanmar (formerly Burma) until quite **recently**, it comes at **enormous** economic cost.
It is not easy for countries to **divorce** the rest of the world.
