Anger is clearly **related** to **aggression** but they are not one and the same.
It is possible to be aggressive without being angry, and it is equally **possible** to be angry without becoming aggressive.
However, the two (the **emotion** of anger and the **behaviour** of aggression) are **linked** and are **biologically** based, with obvious **survival value**.
Anger always **results** in a much increased **burst** of energy and, although biologically based, is seen by some psychologists as largely **socially constructed**.
That is, some people might be **temperamentally** more **prone** to anger than others, but the **extent** to which they **express** this is probably **socially determined**.
In our culture, for example, boys are **encouraged** to express their anger more **openly** than girls and a far greater **proportion** of men than women are made to take anger management courses.
These are **learned** differences, not differences of **biology**.
