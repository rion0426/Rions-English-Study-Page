When we read about psychology, how do we **assess** the **quality** of what we read?
First, we cannot **judge** the quality of an argument on the **basis** of what it **concludes** about people, or on the basis of whether we **agree** with the author's **beliefs** about people or not.
It is quite **possible** for two excellent psychologists to **differ** strongly about an **aspect** of human behaviour, while both providing **convincing** arguments and good **evidence** for reaching their conclusions.
As you read more widely in psychology, you will find that there are many **differences** in opinion among researchers.
It can even be the case that two researchers **conduct** what looks like the same experiment in two different settings, but get very different **results**.
This does not mean, necessarily, that either of the researchers did bad work.
On the **contrary**, different findings from different **contexts** may give us **important** information.
