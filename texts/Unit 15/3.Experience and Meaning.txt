'I'll **believe** it when I see it.'
This **familiar** remark **recalls** how **first-hand** personal experience is commonly **accepted** as a **convincing** way — if not the **fundamental** way — to **determine** what to believe in.
Many centuries ago, for instance, it was **unbelievable** that there could be **organisms** so small as to be **invisible** to the naked eye.
**Opinions** changed after microscopes **allowed** us to see these tiny creatures in the late 1600s.
This **emphasis** upon **direct** personal experience is **philosophically** **expandable** to the point of **prescribing** how words must **derive** their meaning.
The **prescription** would be: if any given word is to be **meaningful**, then it must be **traceable** back to some **sensory** experience.
Otherwise, the word should be **regarded** as only a **meaningless** sound.
This experience-tied theory of meaning was **advocated** by the Scottish philosopher David Hume, an **empiricist** who believed that **knowledge** of what exists or is true can only come from **observing** the world.
